**human-made software for a noisy world.**

we build quiet, high-density applications designed for humans who value focus. from localized productivity tools to globally-aware religious companions, every line of code is an intentional step towards simplicity and respect.

## quick start

simply run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

or run it from live server on index.html

## tech stack

- **frontend:** vanilla js + html5 (no surplus frameworks)
- **backend:** firebase (auth, firestore)
- **styling:** raw css (brutalist, rectangular, clean)
